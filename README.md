# Lunaire
Reading and modelling data gathered from a water rocket

## Why is it called Lunaire?
Because it comes from the french woord for moon. The -aire suffix means it is an adjective, making a lunaire-simulation a moon-simulation. This is because the program was made to track a water rocket, and rockets go up towards the moon.

## What does it do?
It takes a text file with x, y and z coordinates and models an object moving over those coordinates.
