# Contributing to Transcriptase
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### License
Any contributions you make will be licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0

### Report bugs using Github's issues
GitHub issues are used to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Joshua260403/lunaire/issues/new).
Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

##### Good Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* LLVM standard
