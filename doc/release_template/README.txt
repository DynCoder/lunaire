To use the resources you just need to copy all the resources (not the folder itself but the resources within it) to the executable location.

4. Creating a '.lun' file
  1. Create a text file and rename it to '*.lun' (* being any name you choose).
  2. Put a timestep at the top of the .lun file (in milliseconds)
  3. Add 'x y z' on the next line of the file, this is the header.
  4. Add x, y, and z coordinates on seperate lines under the header.
